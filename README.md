# Apple Music Display
The Apple Music App utilizes the Apple Music Api to display a wide variety of songs from various genres.
One of the key features of the app is its custom-made user interface, which is designed to make it easy for users to browse and find the music that falls into the various music genres 

The app utilizes OkHttp, which is a library for handling HTTP networking. This allows the app to make requests to the server and receive responses, which is essential for accessing the music content.

Another important tool used in the app is Retrofit. This is a library that helps manage the process of sending, receiving, and creating HTTP requests and responses. This allows the app to easily communicate with the server and retrieve the necessary information about the music content.

The app also utilizes the Model–view–presenter (MVP) architectural pattern for the user interface. This is a design pattern that helps separate the user interface from the business logic, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase.

Finally, the app uses Picasso library for loading images from external URLs and displaying them in the application. This allows the app to load images quickly and efficiently, which is important for providing a good user experience.
